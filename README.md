The purpose of this project is to explore and practice on the open data provided by [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/). The dataset provided covers the 2018/2019 FA Women's Super League, 2018 Fifa World Cup and the 2018 US NWSL. Our analysis primarily focusses on the 2018 Fifa World Cup however there is room to expand to other competitions in the future. More details on the competitions are stored [here](https://github.com/skarmaniolos/football-science/blob/master/data/raw/competitions.json).
